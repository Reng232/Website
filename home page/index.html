    <p class="section__paragraph">Welcome to the ECC 11 project portfolio page, presented by Kamal and Lukas. This year, for Tech Prep 2024, our mission was to ensure that everyone's project was showcased not only within Saunders Trades and Technical High School but also throughout Yonkers. We dedicated our time and effort to creating this website using languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We hope you enjoy what we have to offer this year!</p>
