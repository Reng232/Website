                <h1>R2D2</h1>
                <p>The project aims to create a detailed replica of R2-D2's head from "Star Wars," focusing on both visual and operational elements. Utilizing the Creality CR 10 S5, the team 3D printed the dome, measuring approximately 450 millimeters (1.48 ft) in diameter. Efforts will include enabling head rotation with servo motors, incorporating speakers for authentic sound effects, and adding LEDs to mimic R2-D2's distinctive blinking and glowing red LED. Programming these features with an Arduino, the project aspires to closely replicate the original robot's functionality and appearance.</p>

                <p>The project incorporates advanced control features, allowing users to manipulate various functions of the R2-D2 replica. Sound control is managed through the controller, providing users with the ability to play and adjust sound effects seamlessly. Additionally, the head can be rotated using the left and right buttons, enhancing the interactive experience. A pivotal component in achieving these functionalities is the ESP32 microcontroller, which plays a crucial role in programming and integrating the various operational aspects of the replica. This technology ensures precise control and enhances the overall authenticity of the R2-D2 model.</p>
