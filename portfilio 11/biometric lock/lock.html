                <h1>Biometric DoorLock</h1>
                <p>Introducing a cutting-edge biometric door lock system. This project showcases the ingenuity of its creators, utilizing the Arduino IDE alongside a fingerprint scanner to ensure only authorized users gain access. Dive deeper into the details of this impressive innovation as you journey through its functionalities.</p>

                <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                <p>Jogita and Emma chose to build this biometric door lock system for their project because it offers a guaranteed method of keeping unauthorized users outside. In a real-world setting, such a system can protect against trespassing or unauthorized access to crucial information. Furthermore, it's more secure than a traditional key, which can be lost or stolen, as a fingerprint is unique to a singular individual. Adding another layer of verification, the phone password ensures security even if fingerprint verification is compromised. Inspired by a social media video depicting a guy using a fingerprint on a door knob, Jogita and Emma embarked on this project, utilizing their ingenuity to create a modern solution for enhanced security.</p>

                <p>Two key features of this project are the fingerprint sensor and the OLED display. The fingerprint sensor detects a person's unique fingerprint, while the OLED display indicates whether the door is locked or unlocked. Additionally, the OLED display alerts users if a fingerprint is not registered properly. These features contribute to the project's functionality and enhance its security measures.</p>
