                <p> One key feature of this project is its ability to measure beats per minute (BPM), providing users with real-time information about their heart rate. This functionality enables individuals to monitor their cardiovascular health and track changes in their heart rate over time. By incorporating BPM monitoring, the project enhances its utility as a comprehensive heart rate monitoring solution for users seeking to maintain optimal health and well-being.</p>
