                <p>Jarvis has a variety of skills, but what makes him unique are his two standout features. The first capability of Jarvis is conducting voice-activated searches using a microphone, enabling users to easily get information by speaking. Moreover, Jarvis has the capability to play music by responding to voice prompts, offering a smooth and hands-free way to enjoy entertainment. Jarvis also stands out for his ability to efficiently perform simple arithmetic tasks, adding to his versatility as a useful tool for a range of daily chores. All of these attributes combined improve Jarvis's capabilities, turning him into an indispensable virtual assistant.</p>

        <h1>Obstacles Faced</h1>
        <p>Several obstacles were encountered during the development of Jarvis. These included coding errors that arose throughout the process and challenges related to time <br>management. Additionally, integrating Jarvis with a Raspberry Pi 4 presented significant difficulties due to the device's limited capabilities and the need for Python libraries that were not readily available on the Raspberry Pi. These challenges required innovative problem-solving and resourcefulness from the development team.</p>
