                <h1>Robot Programming Team</h1>
                <p>This project aims to enhance robotic navigation and object handling using advanced motion planning and vision systems. Alan will employ Pathfinder to design precise movement paths for the robot, utilizing waypoints and global constraints to regulate speed, rotation, and acceleration. Concurrently, Emarviel and Arif will manage the Limelight system, utilizing its camera to detect and track objects via QR codes and calibrating the system through a specialized website. They will apply trigonometry to accurately calculate distances and refine navigation by analyzing visual data, ensuring precise and efficient robotic operations.</p>

                <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                <p>Alan, Emarviel, and Arif's motivation for embarking on this project stems from their keen interest in participating in the FIRST Robotics team for next year's competition. They recognize that engaging in this project will not only provide them with hands-on experience but also equip them with the essential skills and knowledge required to excel in the competition. By delving into advanced motion planning and vision systems, they aim to lay a solid foundation for their future endeavors in robotics. This project serves as a stepping stone towards their aspirations of contributing meaningfully to the field of robotics while honing their abilities as aspiring engineers and technologists.</p>
